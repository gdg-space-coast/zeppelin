  title: "Android Wearables Design Sprint"
  description: "A Design Sprint brings together your entire team to solve important challenges. This includes developers, designers, executives, testers, marketing, etc. Working together you tackle important questions and end up with designs that you can immediately focus on bringing to market quickly. Each step will be time-boxed and we will give you instructions for the next step at each break. We will have Sprintmasters going around the room to answer questions and help the teams. If your team is exciting about your design, you can take it to Startup Weekend Space Coast on November 14! At that weekend-long event, you will be able to build a working version of your design and come up with a business plan to make it a success!"

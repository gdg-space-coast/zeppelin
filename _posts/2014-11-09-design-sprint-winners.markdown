Their design was for a Google Glass enabled, cloud-backed, travel journalism application. The presentations were very clear and informative.
They did a great job of using the wearable with cloud services to deliver a quick and useful application on the watch,
while recognizing that additional refinements and combinations of images and copy would be better handled from a computer or tablet.
This helped free the user from tedious tasks while out in the world, allowing them to finalize their creative work at a convenient time.
Then the user would be able to publish a high quality article rather than just sharing fragments throughout the day.

###### The best thing about this event is that everyone either won or learned!

#### RSVPs for the event have closed

Registration for the event just closed at 7pm ET. We are incredibly excited by the 104 sign ups that we have
recorded for this event! We hope that everyone can make it tomorrow. If you need some motivation, our last
blog post about the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog/event-giveaways">event giveaways</a> and this week's 
<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/10/android-be-together-not-same.html" target="_blank">Android Lollipop</a> announcements should be more than enough!

We may be able to accept a few walk-ins, but you will need to see the registration desk to verify that there is room
and to get a name tag.

#### Parking

Please park in Florida Tech Commons at 3011 S Babcock St, Melbourne, FL 32901. You can see that location and the path
to the Olin Engineering Complex in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/28.0633038,-80.6202904/28.0630887,-80.6236965/@28.0633761,-80.6222103,18z/data=!4m2!4m1!3e2" target="_blank">this map</a>.

#### What should I bring?

Laptops are not required for this event. Feel free to bring cell phones and tablets if you would like, but they are also
not required. If you have a favorite pen or stencil, you should bring that. Nothing else should be required except for
the desire to learn.

DevFest is coming to Brevard County and the Space Coast! The event is scheduled for October 18th, 2014.

We are in the process of bringing the website online now. Once that is done, we will setup registration for the event.
We have confirmed the venue at Florida Tech. We also have a [call for speakers form here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1GWy11zS3c6Er9yxxmR62ygXL9jtgCnXngVZGWZWbxx8/viewform?usp=send_form) if you are interested in presenting at the event.

More details about speakers, registration for Android DevFest, and the venue at FIT will appear in subsequent posts.

#### The event is nearly sold out

We have 96 registered attendees and only 14 tickets for the event remain. Sign up on the official registration site 
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/GDGSpaceCoast/events/208445302/">here</a> to claim one of the last spots.

If you can't make this event date or live in another part of the world, you can find the global DevFest 2014 event
registry at <a href="http://devfest.gdg.events/">devfest.gdg.events</a>.

#### Event video

The event will be recorded but will not be broadcast live over Hangouts on Air. We will edit the videos and post them
to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkiYHK3IZMk5XsYZ626b9Rw">our YouTube channel</a> after the event is over. 
Note that the main value of the event is the collaborative Design Sprint which
you must attend in person to benefit from. The Design Sprint will not be filmed.

#### Sponsors

We are still looking for more sponsors for our largest event of the year. Sponsor inquiries can be made

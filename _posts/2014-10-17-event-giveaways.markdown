#### Event Giveaways

All attendees who complete the Design Sprint and are on a team who presents their idea will be entered in the raffle.
You will be asked to fill out a survey with feedback on the event and must be present to win.

#### Here are some of the prizes


Prizes were made possible by the massive support of <a href="https://developers.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Developers</a>!


##### Motorla G LTE global phones

They will be used to help facilitate the hands-on demos since Android Wear requires being paired to a watch in order
to operate. These five phones run the latest Android 4.4.4 and Motorola just announced that they will be receiving
Android Lollipop soon! All are white and come with 8 GB of internal storage.
They run on T-Mobile and AT&amp;T's high speed LTE networks and have expandable microSD card slots.

##### Android Wear smart watches

We have three LG G Watches and one Samsung Galaxy Live. We tried very hard to get some Motorola 360's but they were
sold out or had shipping delays that would not have been in time for the event. These watches are great for developing
the next new Android Wear app or preparing your existing Android app to work with Android Wear.

##### What about those Android figurines?

Those will be given to the event volunteers in appreciation for their hard work to help support this event. We may
raffle off a few of them along with some T-shirts and other swag at the end if there are any left overs.
